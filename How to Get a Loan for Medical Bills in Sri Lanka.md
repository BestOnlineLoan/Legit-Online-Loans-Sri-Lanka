## 1. Why Medical Loans Are Important in Sri Lanka

In Sri Lanka, even with free public hospitals, **private healthcare is often preferred** due to shorter wait times and better facilities. However, **private treatments can cost between Rs. 50,000 to Rs. 1,000,000** depending on the severity of the condition.

Without **health insurance**, this expense must come out of pocket — and most Sri Lankans don’t have access to instant funds. That's where 💲 **medical loans** can bridge the gap between life-saving care and financial capability.

In all these cases, **speed is crucial**. Delays due to a lack of funds can be life-threatening.
