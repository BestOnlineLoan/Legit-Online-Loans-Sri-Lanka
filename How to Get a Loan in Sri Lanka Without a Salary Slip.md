## 💥 Why Salary Slips Are Often Required for Loans

Most banks and lending institutions ask for **salary slips** because they need to verify:

- Your **ability to repay** the loan.
- Your **employment status**.
- Your **monthly cash flow**.

This standard is fine for salaried workers, but what about:

- Small business owners?
- Freelancers?
- Gig workers?
- Informal income earners?

The reality in Sri Lanka is that **a large portion of the population earns informally**. That’s why more **flexible lending options** are now available. ✅

---

## ✅ Can You Really Get a Loan Without a Salary Slip in Sri Lanka?

**Yes, absolutely.** There are several 💰 *legit loan apps and companies* that don’t ask for a salary slip.

Instead, they assess other **financial behaviors**, such as:

- Mobile wallet activity
- Bank transfers
- Utility payments
- National ID verification
- Social proofing (contact references)

These alternative criteria open the door for *non-traditional earners* to access financial services without the hassle.
